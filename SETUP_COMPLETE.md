2. Right-click on "Default Web Site"
3. Select "Add Virtual Directory"
4. Set alias: `hockeystats`
5. Set physical path: `C:\ColdFusion2023\cfusion\wwwroot\HockeyStatsProject`
6. Click OK

### 2. Verify ColdFusion Configuration

1. Open ColdFusion Administrator
2. Go to "Data & Services" → "Data Sources"
3. Verify "HockeyStats" datasource is configured
4. Test the connection

### 3. Test the Application

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost/hockeystats`
2. Verify the homepage loads correctly
3. Test login functionality
4. Check that images and CSS load properly

### 4. File Permissions (if needed)
